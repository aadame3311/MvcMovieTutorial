# MVC Movie Tutorial

### Goal
To learn the MVC architecture with the ASP.NET web framework.

### Result
Finished the tutorial from the official ASP.NET MVC Microsoft documentation site.

### What I learned
.NET is quite a robust framework. Had good security features and overall the framework was easy to understand for me as I have some experience working in these architectures in Rails and Laravel. C# is also a good programming language. I had some experience with C# working in game development, but this was the first time I used it for web development and I found it to be a smooth transition. I also learned how to use the asp-codegenerator to generate controllers with CRUD functionality and also how to protect the app from "overposting" by binding specific attributes that the post request should take.

### What I struggled with
I struggled a bit understanding some of the relations between the classes when it came to add the SQLite database to the project. As I moved on through the tutorial, it all made more sense.
